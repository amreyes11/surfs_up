Overview of the analysis: 
Thorough analysis for the ice cream and surf shop weather data has been provided already but it has been requested to provide additional information.  The investor is requesting additional temperature trends before making a solid decision on the opening of the surf shop.  He specifically is wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu.  This will help determine if the surf shop and ice cream shop will be successful and sustainable.

3.  The average difference between June and December do not vary much in temperature and real feel.  


Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.
In summary, the average temperatures seem to align with appropriate weather for having an ice cream shop and surfs shop in the area.  
Besides tracking temperature, I'd like to run queries for rain water, precipitation, storms, wind conditions to name a few and its highest peak season.  To rely only on temperature is not a bright plan especially when the area sees a variety of weather due to its location.  

Also, I'd run data and statistics of where the highest foot traffic is at and what time of the year is best.  This can help identify and isolate the best location for the shop.  

Ulimately, based on temperatures only, the shop is a good idea.
